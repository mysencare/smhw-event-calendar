# smhw-event-calendar

We ask candidates to undertake a small development exercise for us so they can demonstrate their technical prowess. In this instance, we want you to build  a simple Rails application which comprises an events calendar. This application will consist of an /events page which displays a weekly calendar highlighting the current date. Application users must be able to create an event which contains start and end date plus a description.

Furthermore, the created event should instantly show on the calendar along with some indication as to when the event starts and finishes. The image on the /events page provides an example of what we are looking for.

Given this requirement, candidates should create an EventsController with these actions: index, create.

Events should be saved in a backend store without refreshing the page.

Candidates may use any gems/plugins when building your solution. However, we will question candidates on their choices of gems/plugins.

Please commit changes to git often with descriptive messages. These messages and the granularity of commits will be examined.

Candidates should take no longer than 2/3 hours.

A basic project is available in https://github.com/mysencare/smhw-event-calendar. 

You can fork this project, and then when you have completed the work to your satisfaction, please raise a pull request for our attention.
